Key Takeaways:
- In general (across 2020 and 2021 and for all products), the top two cities for total products sold were New York, NY (111954 products sold) and the Houston, TX (90322 products sold). The top two cities for total sales were New York, NY ($39,801,235 in total sales) and the San Francisco, CA ($33,973,228 in total sales). This indicates that although total products sold were higher in Houston than in San Francisco (which was third in total products sold), that the products sold in San Francisco must have been higher priced or of higher price.
